# SharpGfx
This is a little .NET graphics framework. The framework has some similarity to three.js. It is used for educational purposes and it is the intension to slowly develop it further in the comming the years.

There are currently two implementations: one is based on OpenGL directly and the other is using OpenTK, an OpenGL abstraction layer for .NET. The frawework can be used under Windows and Linux (the implementation using OpenTK obviously depends on the latters Linux support).

Check out the Wiki for an example use!

You find the packages for SharpGfx on nuget.org.
