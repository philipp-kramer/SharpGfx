# SharpGfx

This  framework is designed for developing graphics desktop applications for both Windows and Linux on the dotnet platform. 
It can use either Open GL or Nvidia OptiX for rendering, with the latter applying real-time ray tracing. 
One of its key strengths lies in its lightweight implementation, which facilitates easier comprehension and extension. 
Additionally, it provides seamless integration of GLSL, simplifying the process of writing custom OpenGL shaders. 
Due to these advantageous features, SharpGfx is highly suitable for educational purposes.

You find the packages for SharpGfx on nuget.org to include this framework into your project.

Currently, there is only minimal documentation in the wiki that should be extended.
