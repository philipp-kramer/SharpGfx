.NET / OpenGL graphics framework

This is a little graphics framework for educational purposes. It will hopefully be developed further over the years.

It is the intension to use at least one more low-level graphics API. Hence some efforts have already been made to leave this open, but it is currently geared towards OpenGL (it uses OpenTK). It is to be expected that there will be breaking changes should this happen.
