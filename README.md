# SharpGfx
This is a little .NET / OpenGL graphics framework. It is used for educational purposes. It will hopefully be developed further over the years.

It is the intension to target at least one more low-level graphics API. Hence some efforts have already been made to leave this open, but it is currently geared towards OpenGL (by using OpenTK). It is to be expected that there will be numerous breaking changes should this happen.
